# aframe-sdf-component
A Mozilla A-Frame component for loading [Gazebo's](http://gazebosim.org/)
[Simulation Description Format (SDF)](http://sdformat.org/) models as components

## Goals
The primary goal for this project is to create a means to load SDF files
directly into a Mozilla A-Frame simulation along with working physics based. The
physics simulation aspect is provided by
[Don McCurdy's A-Frame Physics System](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system)

## Stretch Ideas
Adding the ability to also load [ROS](http://www.ros.org/)
[URDF files](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) would someday be helpful for a more
general robotics simulation toolkit. However, it may be more advisable to create
a separate repository for such a loader.
